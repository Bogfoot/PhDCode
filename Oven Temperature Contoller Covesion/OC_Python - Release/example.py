"""
Below are two usage examples of the OC.py Python class for control of the OC range of temperature controllers.

The OC class requires a Python version of 3.10 or greater to run. The class also relies upon an external module,
PySerial (https://pyserial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pyserial.html#installation), which must be installed 
before the OC class can be used. This can usually be done by either running:

python -m pip install pyserial

or 

conda install pyserial

from the command line (for example, in windows Powershell or with cmd.exe) depending on whether your system uses
pip or conda.

Additionally, the example scripts use both numpy (https://numpy.org/) and matplotlib (https://matplotlib.org/)

# --------  Example 1: Temperature stability testing -----------
#
# This example sets the setpoint of the OC controller and enables
# the output and waits for the temperature to stabilise within a
# given range of the setpoint value, over a predefined period,
# before concluding that the temperature is stable.
#
# Reading of the state of the OC is done here through a direct call
# to the get_status() method. This requests the status of the
# controller and heater and places the returned values

# Define stability criteria
target_temperature = 45  # units: C
stability_range = 0.1  # units: C
stability_time = 20  # units: s

    # setpoint that the controller is aiming for, and the current
    # temperature of the oven.

    # Fault check

# ------- Example 2: Slow temperature ramping with continuous update -----
#
# This example demonstrates the ability of the OC controller to control both
# rate of change of temperature, as well as the final temperature, and also the
# continous update function of the OC to relieve the need for continuous polling.
# The computer's serial bus is monitored to see if any bytes are available and,
# when there are, these bytes are read into the OC object and parsed. When enough
# bytes are received to make a full message from the OC, the message is parsed and
# the relevant properties of the OC object (current temperature, setpoint temperature,
# faults present) are updated as a tuple of their value and the time the message
# was received.
# Operating in this way reduces the time spent communicating with the device, freeing
# the resource for other aspects of your program.

# Make an OC object
oc = OC.OC(com_port)

# Define the ramp conditions
ramp_end = 80  # Final temperature of the ramp. Units: C
ramp_rate = 0.1  # Rate of change of temperature. Units C/s

# Make a variable to log temperatures

# Enable the OC output

# Monitor the ramp
while oc.temperature[0] < oc.requested_temperature:

    # and then, if a message is available, the message_available property is set to true
